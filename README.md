# rock-paper-scissors
Attempt 1: Goal was have the user input 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissor' as text in a popup window. The computer would select a random option. The player would play against the computer until a winner reaches 5 wins. This was accomplished through a loop. Results were displayed in console.

Attempt 2: Initial attempt at adding UI by manipulating the DOM. Issue here was configuing event listener so that each button selection would effect a player input. This attempt worked in console where only the player selection was recognized. However, this attempt failed when using the button.id as playerSelection in the game() function.

Attempt 3: This attempt worked.
